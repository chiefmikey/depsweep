### **Cache Settings**
```typescript
// Dependency analysis cache (5 minutes TTL, 2000 entries)
const depInfoCache = new OptimizedCache<DependencyInfo>(2000, 300000);

// File content cache (1 minute TTL, 500 entries)
const fileCache = new OptimizedCache<string>(500, 60000);

// Pattern cache (5 minutes TTL, 500 entries)
const patternCache = new OptimizedCache<RegExp[]>(500, 300000);
```

### **Batch Processing**
```typescript
// Dynamic batch sizing based on memory
const BATCH_SIZE = Math.min(200, Math.max(20, Math.floor(availableMemory / (1024 * 1024 * 25))));

// Concurrency limits
const MAX_CONCURRENT_READS = 10;
```

### **Memory Management**
```typescript
// Memory pressure thresholds
const gcThreshold = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB
const GC_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
# Run with verbose performance metrics
depsweep --verbose

# Output includes:
# - Operation timing
# - Memory usage statistics
# - Cache hit rates

### **Memory Optimization**
```typescript
// Automatic memory pressure handling
const memoryStats = memoryOptimizer.checkMemoryUsage();
if (memoryStats.shouldGC) {
  // Clear caches and trigger GC
  depInfoCache.clear();
  fileReader.clearCache();
}
```

### **Batch Processing**
```typescript
// Optimized file processing
const results = await dependencyAnalyzer.processFilesInBatches(
  files,
  dependency,
  context,
  (processed, total) => {
    // Progress callback
    onProgress?.(processed, total);
  }
